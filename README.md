# Currency-converter-GUI


This currency converter incorporates the exchange rate API to retrieve the current exchange rate of different currencies.
The default currencies are set as GBP and USD, the former chosen logically and the latter lending itself the API's design
Using an OOP approach to create the GUI. This approach is good for classifying and organising data. 
The data classified and grouped are done so in a logical manner.
